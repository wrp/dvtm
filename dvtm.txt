== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=== DVTM
Each process spawned by dvtm will have this variable set to the dvtm version it is running under.

=== DVTM_WINDOW_ID
Each process also has access to its constant and unique window id.

=== DVTM_CMD_FIFO
If the -c command line argument was specified upon dvtm startup, this variable will be set to the file name of the named pipe. Thus allowing the
process to send commands back to dvtm.

=== DVTM_STATUS_FIFO
If the -s command line argument was specified upon dvtm startup, this variable will be set to the file name of the named pipe.

=== DVTM_TERM
By default dvtm uses its own terminfo file and therefore sets TERM=dvtm within the client windows. This can be overridden by setting the DVTM_TERM
environment variable to a valid terminal name before launching dvtm.

=== DVTM_EDITOR
When entering the copymode dvtm pipes the whole scroll back buffer to dvtm-editor(1) which opens the content in DVTM_EDITOR, with fallbacks to VISUAL,
EDITOR and vi(1) config.h is used instead.

== EXAMPLE
See the dvtm-status(1) script as an example of how to display text in the status bar.

== FILES
dvtm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source code.  This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
